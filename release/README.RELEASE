This procedure was tested on a Pi4B and CM4.

Before creating a new release (pihpsdr.tar), make sure
wdsp is up to date.

The below steps may be different depending on where your
wdsp and pihpsdr repos are copied to and named.

cd wdsp
git pull
make clean
make -j9

cd ../pihpsdr
git pull
make clean
make -j9
cp pihpsdr release/pihpsdr/
cp ../wdsp/libwdsp.so release/pihpsdr/

cd release
rm -f pihpsdr.tar
tar cvf pihpsdr.tar pihpsdr
