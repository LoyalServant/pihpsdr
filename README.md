# pihpsdr
Standalone code for HPSDR,
supporting both the old (P1) and new (P2) HPSDR protocols, as well as the SoapySDR framework.

It runs on Linux (including RaspPi 3/4) and MacOS (using the "Homebrew" working environment).

Latest features:

- dynamic screen resizing in the "Screen" menu, with automatic font size adjustment
- PureSignal now works with Anan-10E/100B in P1
- HermesLite-II drive slider now working smoothly
- CW audio peak filter (in the CW menu)
- Improved layout for nearly all menus
- Option to make Combo-Boxed "TouchScreen-Friendly" (Radio Menu)

Installation by compiling from the sources is highly recommended,
since binaries may cease to work across OS upgrades.

A detailed instruction for this can be found in the source code
folder file ..../pihpsdr/release/documentation/Linux-CompileFromSources.pdf.

The "scripts.tar" file mentioned there is also available in the
releases/documentation folder
