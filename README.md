since binaries may cease to work across RaspberryPi OS upgrades.

A detailed instruction for this can be found in the source code
folder file ..../pihpsdr/release/documentation/Linux-CompileFromSources.pdf.

The "scripts.tar" file mentioned there is also available in the
releases/documentation folder
